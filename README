  Fan Controller Application
/*****************************/
1. Input to Test.txt
 a. No. of subsystems. Max_SUB_SYSTEM are 10
 b. No. of fans   MAX_FANS are 6
 c. Asummption: For each next line user should provide PWM count for each fan at 100% Duty Cycle. 
 d. The temperature for subsystem is generated in double from random number generator between 0 to 100. 
 e. It is written periodically by subsystem process.  

2. The TopWrapper process forks FanController process and process for each subsystem

3. IPC between fan controller and subsystem is created through shared memory. 
  a. Shared memory to read/write temperature. 

4. SubSystem processes read from random number generator temperature after periodic sleep.
     a. Random number generator is provided with different seed for each subsystem. 

4. Fan controller process reads temperature from all subsystem if there is any change. 

5. Interpolation method  for temperature between 25 to 75 oc
  
   (PWM Count)@currMaxTemp = (PWMCount)@20%DutyCycle + (((PWMCount)@100%DutyCycle -(PWMCount)@20%DutyCycle)/(75-25))*(CurrMaxTemp - 25)

6. PWM counts are written to the register bank with max number of fan counts. 

6. Command to build:

    make all

7. Command to Clean:
   
   make clean

8. Command to run:

  ./TopWrapper
 
9. To change input
   Change Test.txt file.

10. How to stop program 
     ctrl-c
